# Azure AI Vision Integration with Web App

## Introduction

In an era marked by groundbreaking technologies, Artificial Intelligence stands out as a field where Cloud Vendors are investing extensively. Azure AI Services, including Cognitive Services, are at the forefront, offering a range of accessible products for both novice and experienced users in development and production environments.

Our focus today is on exploring **Azure AI Vision** with the integration of the **Computer Vision API** in a web application for object detection. This project expands to the use of Azure Container Registry for Web Apps and involves building a Python application with Flask, containerizing it with Docker, and configuring Continuous Deployment with Webhooks.

## Deployment

This project involves a deployment setup using Terraform. Here's a brief overview of the deployment process:

### Prerequisites

- **Code Editor**: We are using VSCode for our development.
- **Standard Files**: The necessary files for deployment, focusing on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

### Terraform Configuration

- **`main.tf`**: This file is the core of our Terraform configuration.
